            Albert Einstein 14 March 1879  18 April
            1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,[7] widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most
            influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he
            also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and
            quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics.[3][8] His massenergy equivalence formula E = mc2,
            which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".[9] His work is also
            known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[10][11] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics
            "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
            effect",[12] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and
            originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".[13] Einsteinium, one of the synthetic
            elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.
