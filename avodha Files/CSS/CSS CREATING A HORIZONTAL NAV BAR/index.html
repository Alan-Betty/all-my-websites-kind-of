        <p> A wiki enables communities of editors and contributors to write documents collaboratively. All that people
            require to contribute is a computer, Internet access, a web browser, and a basic understanding of a simple
            markup language (e.g. MediaWiki markup language). A single page in a wiki website is referred to as a "wiki
            page", while the entire collection of pages, which are usually well-interconnected by hyperlinks, is "the
            wiki". A wiki is essentially a database for creating, browsing, and searching through information. A wiki
            allows non-linear, evolving, complex, and networked text, while also allowing for editor argument, debate,
            and interaction regarding the content and formatting.[10] A defining characteristic of wiki technology is
            the ease with which pages can be created and updated. Generally, there is no review by a moderator or
            gatekeeper before modifications are accepted and thus lead to changes on the website. Many wikis are open to
            alteration by the general public without requiring registration of user accounts. Many edits can be made in
            real-time and appear almost instantly online, but this feature facilitates abuse of the system. Private wiki
            servers require user authentication to edit pages, and sometimes even to read them. Maged N. Kamel Boulos,
            Cito Maramba, and Steve Wheeler write that the open wikis produce a process of Social Darwinism. "...
            because of the openness and rapidity that wiki pages can be edited, the pages undergo an evolutionary
            selection process, not unlike that which nature subjects to living organisms. 'Unfit' sentences and sections
            are ruthlessly culled, edited and replaced if they are not considered 'fit', which hopefully results in the
            evolution of a higher quality and more relevant page."
